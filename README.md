Lab 5 in D0003E Real-Time System at LTU
=======================================
This is my source code for the fifth laboration in the course D0003E Real-Time System at Lule√• University of Technology. Done in fall of 2011. This is meant to be run on a computer with a serial port connect to a AVR Butterfly. The program on the computer is the simulation of cars entering a bridge from north and south.

The controller part is the traffic control system. Not uploaded to github, I've lost it somewhere.
